"""Single source of truth for accessibility scoring (Canvas Remedy-52, Canvas Remedy-55).

There used to be three independent score formulas in the codebase, all of them
broken in different ways for any course with real issue volume:

* ``dashboard_service.py``: ``100 - (errors/pages * 50)`` — clamped to 0 above
  ~2 errors/page.
* ``ScanService.calculate_score``: ``100 - errors * 5`` — clamped to 0 above
  20 errors total.
* ``CourseACR.conformance_percentage``: counted criteria as 0/0.5/1.0 ignoring
  density, so 264 alt-text failures still left a criterion at 0.5.

ENGL_C1000 with 788 errors / 189 pages produced ``score=0`` on the dashboard
and ``91.7% Excellent`` on the ACR for the same data — same label, opposite
stories.

This module owns the formulas now. Every call site delegates here. If product
later wants a different scoring philosophy, swap a body and every UI updates.

The course-score formula is severity-weighted, density-normalized, exp-decay-
bounded:

    weighted = errors + 0.25 * warnings
    density  = weighted / pages
    score    = 100 * exp(-density / 4)

The ACR conformance percentage uses density-aware partial credit: each
PARTIALLY_SUPPORTS criterion's contribution decays from 0.5 toward 0 as its
finding count grows, with a half-life of 20 findings.

Both functions are continuous, monotonic, never < 0 or > 100.
