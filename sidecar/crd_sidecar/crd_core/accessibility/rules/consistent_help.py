"""Accessibility rules for consistent help mechanisms (WCAG 3.2.6).

HELP001 is a **course-level** rule: it flags placement inconsistencies
across a course's pages rather than emitting a per-page notice for
every "help/support/contact" link.

Pre-change behavior: every <a> whose text contained "help", "support",
"contact", "faq", or "assistance" was flagged as an INFO issue on every
page it appeared. This conflated in-content help references (e.g.,
"If you experience trouble, contact support@cvc.edu") with the WCAG
3.2.6 placement requirement, producing large amounts of noise without
actionable signal.

Post-change behavior: the rule looks for a help-link *convention* —
the same help href appearing in the "footer slot" of 2+ pages — and
only flags pages that break the convention by missing the shared link.
Courses with no convention (or single outliers) stay silent.

"Footer slot" heuristic, in order of preference:
  1. Inside an explicit <footer> element
  2. Inside any element with role="contentinfo"
  3. The last top-level child of <body> (catches courses that put a
     trailing "Need help? Contact X" paragraph on every page)
